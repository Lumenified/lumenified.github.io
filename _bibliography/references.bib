  abstract = "We have carried out an analysis of amplified DNA sequences
              present in a tumorigenic mouse cell line, designated 3T3DM, to
              determine if the presence of cellular transforming activity is
              correlated with the elevated expression of any of the amplified
              genes. These studies utilized a selection protocol that allowed
              for DNA sequence amplification after the introduction of each
              gene into non-transformed recipient cells. Cell lines obtained
              from this selection protocol were assayed for tumorigenicity in
              nude mice. The results provided evidence that a gene, mdm2, that
              is amplified more than 50-fold in the 3T3DM cell line, induces
              tumorigenicity when experimentally overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells
              and in Rat2 cells. Analysis of the predicted amino acid
              composition of the mdm2 product(s) revealed features similar to
              those that have been shown to be functionally significant in
              certain DNA binding proteins/transcriptional activators. These
              include two potential metal binding motifs and a negatively
              charged domain rich in acidic amino acid residues. Overall, the
              data support the conclusion that mdm2 represents an
              evolutionarily conserved gene with tumorigenic potential and a
              predicted role in mechanisms of cellular growth control.",

  title    = "Mutant p53 {DNA} clones from human colon carcinomas cooperate

  abstract = "The majority of the p53 genes derived from human colorectal
              carcinomas contain point mutations. A significant number of these
              mutations occur in or around amino acids 143, 175, 273, or 281.
              Experiments presented here demonstrate for the first time that
              p53 DNA clones containing any one of these mutations cooperate
              with the activated ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo
              cells in culture. These transformed cells produce elevated levels
              of the human p53 protein, which has extended half-lives (1.5-7
              h), as compared to the wild-type human p53 protein (20-30 min).
              The p53 mutant with an alteration at residue 175 (p53-175H) binds
              tightly to the cellular heat shock protein, hsc70. In contrast,
              the p53 mutants possessing mutations at either residue 273 or 281
              (p53-273H/281G) do not bind detectably to this heat shock protein
              and generally are less efficient at forming transformed foci in
              culture. The transformed cell lines are tumorigenic in nude mice.
              Thus, two classes of p53 mutant proteins can be distinguished:
              p53-175H, which cooperates with ras efficiently and binds to
              hsc70, and p53-273H/281G, which has a reduced efficiency of
              transformed foci formation and does not bind hsc70. This
              demonstrates that complex formation between mutant p53 and hsc70
              is not required for p53-mediated transformation, but rather it
              facilitates this function, perhaps by ensuring sequestration of
              the endogenous wild-type p53 protein. The positive effect on cell
              proliferation by these mutant p53 proteins is consistent with a
              role for activated p53 mutants in the genesis of colorectal
              carcinomas.",

              kd (p90) that forms a complex with both mutant and wild-type p53
              protein has been characterized, purified, and identified. The
              protein was identified as a product of the murine double minute 2
              gene (mdm-2). The mdm-2 gene enhances the tumorigenic potential
              of cells when it is overexpressed and encodes a putative
              transcription factor. To determine if mdm-2 could modulate p53
              transactivation, a p53-responsive element from the muscle
              creatine kinase gene was employed. A wild-type p53-expressing
              plasmid enhanced the expression of the p53-responsive element
              when cotransfected into cells that contain no endogenous p53.
              When a cosmid expressing mdm-2 was transfected with this
              p53-expressing plasmid, the transactivation of the p53-responsive
              element was inhibited. Thus, a product of the mdm-2 oncogene
              forms a tight complex with the p53 protein, and the mdm-2
              oncogene can inhibit p53-mediated transactivation.",
